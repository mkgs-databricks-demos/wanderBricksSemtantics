# Session: initial bundle scaffold
**Date:** 2026-08-28

## Problems
* Needed to scaffold the `wb-metric-views` bundle so metric views can be registered into a target Unity Catalog schema.
* Needed a simple end-to-end validation path to confirm bundle resources and metric-view registration wiring are correct.
* Needed to capture project conventions for feature branch workflow, session summaries, and resource references.

## Root Causes
* The bundle started as a blank scaffold and did not yet include the schema resource, registration job, registration notebook, metric view fixtures, or project memory.
* Bundle notebook path expectations required validation against how the created notebook is materialized on disk.

## Changes
* Added bundle-level `catalog` variable configuration in [databricks.yml](#file-903099149301205), with target-specific values for `dev` and `prod`.
* Created schema resource in [wb_metric_views.schema.yml](#file-903099149301258) for `${var.catalog}.wb_metric_views`.
* Created generic registration job in [register_metric_views.job.yml](#file-903099149301259) with `catalog_use` and `schema_use` parameters referencing `${var.catalog}` and `${resources.schemas.wb_metric_views_schema.name}`.
* Created registration notebook [register_metric_views](#notebook-903099149301261) to discover metric view YAML files, inject target catalog/schema values, and execute `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ... WITH METRICS LANGUAGE YAML`.
* Created simple verification metric view fixture [mv_properties.metric_view.yml](#file-903099149301263) using [samples.wanderbricks.properties](#table) with basic dimensions and measures.
* Created session summary structure under [fixtures/sessions](#folder-903099149301255) and seeded [INDEX.md](#file-903099149301256).
* Created and updated [project_memory.md](#file-903099149301253) with bundle conventions.

## Decisions
* Follow feature-branch-only workflow; never commit directly to `main`.
* Store bundle-specific conventions in `project_memory.md` at the bundle root instead of `.assistant_instructions.md`.
* Reference deployed resources through `${resources.<type>.<id>.<value_name>}` throughout the bundle.
* Keep the metric-view registration flow in Python for now by looping across `*.metric_view.yml` definitions inside a single notebook task.
* Use a simple WanderBricks-based metric view first to validate wiring before expanding to richer metric definitions.
* Use the created notebook's `.py` path in the job resource because that is how the notebook is materialized for bundle validation in this workspace.
